# CC Trade Viewer

> View recent trades on cryptocurrency exchanges

This app was built to fulfill an assignment as a part of my internship with [Apollo DAE](https://apollodae.io/).

It allows users to search exchanges provided in the [CCXT Library](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt).

Users can search markets based on asset trading pairs and view the most recent trades on that market.

Trades refresh every 5 seconds.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project

```
